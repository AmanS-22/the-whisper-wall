# 🧱 The Whisper Wall

> Not every word needs a signature.

**The Whisper Wall** is an anonymous public note board where anyone can share thoughts freely — without usernames, profiles, or identity.  
A quiet space for honesty, expression, and reflection.

## 🌿 About the Project

In a world where every post is tied to identity, metrics, and visibility,  
**The Whisper Wall** explores expression **without ownership**.

No logins.
